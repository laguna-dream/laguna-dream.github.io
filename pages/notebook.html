            <p>
                currently sitting in bhoomi's new place in goa, hibernating. i wanted a
                little space on my website to park stuff
                that floats through my head but never get around to because of the
                pressure
                of developing those thoughts into fully fledged pieces.
            <p>
                i guess this might help. the caveat might be that these off the cuff thoughts/notes might only
                ever be on this website (and not say, in my personal notes), and i'm not sure what that means for if i
                do want to develop them later, or
                save them in a more easily viewable and editable format locally that is not this html file. but maybe it
                might be interesting
                to have these be consciously public notes.
            <p>
                i think i will worry about that later. what i'm worried about right now is that i write really long
                sentences and the text in this vscode editor doesnt naturally take me to a next line unless i press
                enter and since
                most of my thoughts are run-on stream of consciousness, i dont find myself doing that very often since i
                never find the break to do it and so half the text is hidden on one side of the screen and i dont like
                that very much so i will have to see what to do about this. figure out configuring.

            <p>
                list of stuff to figure out for website:
                <li>figure out how to make vscode a more comfortable text editor for my purposes</li>
                <li>explore alternatives but only for later</li>
                <li>post one of my wip pieces on 'writing'</li>
                <li>ead through that odin project thing so i progress pass the flailing button pressing stage of
                    building this
                    website</li>
                <li>for the 'curios' page - figure out a tagging system and format - thinking
                    4chan-esque grid thing and you can click into those boxes. just want to try to recreate a 4chan ui
                    actually.
                </li>
                <li>influences page? for music? movies? books?one section that's more timeless/formative and one that's
                    more recent. </li>
                <li>actually the timeless influences page should be separate from the recently reading etc, and should
                    only link from the home page (?)</li>
                <li>i would like one more section for updates on projects, and figuring out how to inject my 'work'
                    thoughts
                    (????) into this website, not sure if that should be another website itself. or just make a separate
                    page for 'projects'. anyway this kind of 'work' is separate from my other 'work'</li>
                <li>i don't know what i mean when i say 'work'</li>
                <li>i do have to figure out what that means for me</li>
                <li>i really like making groups and tags and segments and i think i need to figure out how to step back
                    and minmize the number of divisions between things and think of smarter more generalized ways that
                    allow me to simply build a useful website and not bind myself into a prison of my own making</li>
                <li>my homepage. put a 'recents' thing there. maybe start putting (v1) drafts on things?
                    put a little hello bio message.
                    not sure what else yet. sit on this.
                </li>
            <p>
                i don't know what my purpose with this website is. off late maybe i'm thinking it doesn't matter. i'm
                lucky. i'm alive. i'm not going to question these urges. good night everyone.
