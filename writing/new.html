        <small>I found this in my notes from October 2023. Now that I have a website I think some of these old notes
            might be nice to post.
            I'm trying to avoid making any edits to them. Even if I might not relate so much anymore.</small>

        <b> Oh of course I know how to write </b>
        <br><br>
        I know how to write like my body knows how to spill blood at the slightest touch of the sharpest blade on my
        baby skin that sees no light of day, words gushing out without abandon before the scars begin to form
        <br><br>
        I know how to write like my body knows how to congeal the the wound on my knee into white blood cell clots and
        dried skin to prevent anything from flowing outward, closed shut off forever until the next foolhardy fall
        tosses me to my death
        <br><br>
        I know how to write like my body knows how to pad silently down the hall in my parents house when everyone is
        asleep to the liquor cabinet to pour myself whiskies
        <br><br>
        I know how to write like I know how to live like im trying to tell you that this is the only thing I know apart
        from swimming and crying and copying and listening and loving, I don’t know anything else, and you must know
        that even If I don’t write I know how to write and I know I will know how to write again someday because
        <br><br>
        I know how to write like my body knows how to well up tears at any thought that crosses the sticky hedge of my
        mind that makes me think of all the childhood longing I once had and all the childhood fears I have surpassed
        and like all the eternal sadness I have always thought about
        <br><br>
        I know how to write like I know why I journaled for 10 years straight like how my father kept a blog ‘fly
        without wings’ like how the only thing that saved me repeatedly when people didn’t call me for parties or
        thought I was too much or when I discovered alcohol worked a bit differently for me or when I
        had nothing to do on a Friday Saturday night or when I was high and alone and listening to music or like when I
        wrote fanfiction about love I could not possibly understand or like
        <br><br>
        How I know how to write knowing that no one will ever see this
        <br><br>

        You don’t get it, I really know how to write
